sopel-website
=============

Website for [Sopel](https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel), deployed at https://sopel.chat

Made for use with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's not hosted on GitHub
Pages, primarily so that we can have direct access to some other stuff under
the `sopel.chat` domain (meetbot logs, command docs at some point, etc.)
