sopel.chat
==========

Website for [Sopel](https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel), deployed at https://sopel.chat

Made for use with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's not hosted on GitHub
Pages, primarily so that we can have a more complex build process. (The [build
script](netlify-build.sh) calls some extra scripts to auto-generate some
things based on a specific version of Sopel's code.)


Working with automatically generated pages
