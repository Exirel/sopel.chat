**Note: This guide applies to Sopel 7, which is still in development. You can
try out these features by [running Sopel from source]({{ site.repo
}}#latest-source).**

If your Sopel bot is in many channels, you've probably run into at least one
case where a module that one channel loves is hated by the users and/or
operators in another. This is pretty commonâ€”after all, every IRC channel is a
fiefdom with its own dictator, who may or may not be benevolent.

Fortunately, configuring Sopel to work around such situations is easy.

## Channel config sections

In Sopel's config file, you can add sections for channels you want to treat
specially. For example:

```cfg
[#FunHaters]
disable_modules = emoticons,instagram,reddit,xkcd
disable_commands = {"dice": ["roll", "choose"], "url": ["title_auto"]}
```

The channel name is taken literally; no pattern-matching is supported, for now.

In channels named `#FunHaters`, this would disable the `emoticons`, `instagram`,
`reddit`, and `xkcd` modules entirely; it would also prevent the automatic
title-fetcher from `url` from running (but still allow the manual `.title`
command), and block use of the `.roll` and `.ch` commands from the `dice`
module. Details for each option below.

### `disable_modules`

The `disable_modules` option is a simple comma-separated list of module names,
just like [`core.enable`]({{ site.docs
}}config.html#sopel.config.core_section.CoreSection.enable) or
[`core.exclude`]({{ site.docs
}}config.html#sopel.config.core_section.CoreSection.exclude).

### `disable_commands`

The `disable_commands` option is written as a Python dict, where each key is a
module name and each value is a list of method names within that module.

Be sure to use the _method_ name, not the _command_ name. Matching on method
names makes it possible to disable things like URL handlers, too.

*Note: A future version of Sopel might move to a YAML config file format instead
of the INI format it uses now, to simplify the inclusion of more complex,
structured options like this. Let us know [on
IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/#sopel) if you think this is a good idea.*
