title: Using Sopel
permalink: /usage/
---

Some of Sopel's features warrant additional documentation, beyond what can be
(readily) included in Sopel's `.help` output.

While the [plugin documentation]({% link docs/plugin.html %}) is intended for
developers, these usage documents are targeted squarely at usersâ€”those running
or using the bot. The goal is to explain how to do useful things with Sopel,
without writing any code.

{% assign docs = site.usage | where_exp: "doc", "doc.url != page.url" | sort: "order" %}
{% for doc in docs %}
  * [{{ doc.title }}]({{ doc.url }})
{% endfor %}
